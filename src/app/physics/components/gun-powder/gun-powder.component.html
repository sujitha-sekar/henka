          <h4 class="sub-content" style="font-size: 21px;">It's all about the chemistry and how efficient the reaction.
            The formula has been tried and tested for
            many hundreds of years and the best formula is "75/15/10," which means 75% potassium nitrate, 15% charcoal
            and 10% sulfur. This formula has been known for centuries as one which will produce powerful black powder.

          <h5 class="sub-head">1. Potassium Nitrate (Saltpeter) - 75%</h5>
          <p class="sub-content">Acts as the oxidizer, providing the oxygen needed for the combustion process.</p>
          <h5 class="sub-head">2. Charcoal (Carbon) - 15%</h5>
          <p class="sub-content">The fuel, which burns to produce hot gases that cause expansion and propulsion.</p>
          <h5 class="sub-head">3. Sulfur - 10%</h5>
          <p class="sub-content">Lowers the ignition temperature and increases the speed of combustion, making the
            mixture more efficient.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Modern Gun Powder</h2>
        <p class="sub-content"> It is generally made from <span
            style="background-color: var(--dark-green-color); padding:4px 8px;font-weight:600; color: #000a00;">nitrocellulose</span>
          as the base material. The nitrocellulose may be
          derived from purified cellulose, such as from cotton linters or wood, which is then nitrated by being treated
          with nitric and sulfuric acids. Pistol powders and some rifle powders may also contain as much as 40%
          nitroglycerin. This is called a double based powder. Not only do the components matter significantly, even the
          size and shape of the granules of powder have a tremendous effect on the pressure produced. Very fine granules
          burn much faster that large pellets of powder. The largest nitrocellulose granules are larger than your thumb
          and were used in 16 inch naval guns.</p>
