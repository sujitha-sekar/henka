        <span class="content1">Rocket propulsion is the method by which a rocket is lifted off the ground and propelled
          through the air. Thrust is the force which moves any aircraft through the air. Thrust is generated by the
          propulsion system of the aircraft. Different propulsion systems develop thrust in different ways, but all
          thrust is generated through some application of Newton's third law of motion. For every action there is an
          equal and opposite reaction.</span>

      <h1 class="type-head">Liquid Propellant Rocket</h1>
      <h4 class="type-content"> In a liquid rocket, the propellants, the fuel and the oxidizer, are stored separately as liquids and are
        pumped into the combustion chamber of the nozzle where burning occurs. With a liquid rocket, you can stop the thrust by
        turning off the flow of propellants. Liquid rockets tend to be heavier and more complex because of the pumps and
        storage tanks and most expensive due to their complexity. The propellants are loaded into the rocket just before
        launch.</h4>

      <h1 class="type-head">Solid Propellant Rocket</h1>
      <h4 class="type-content"> In a solid rocket, the propellants are mixed together and packed into a solid cylinder. Under normal
        temperature conditions, the propellants do not burn; but they will burn when exposed to a source of heat
        provided by an igniter. Once the burning starts, it proceeds until all the propellant is exhausted. A solid rocket is
        much easier to handle and can sit for years before firing. It can generate more thrust over shorter periods and
        simple design, cheap to build.</h4>
